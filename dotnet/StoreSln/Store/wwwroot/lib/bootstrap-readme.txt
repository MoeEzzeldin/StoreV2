This is a placeholder for Bootstrap library files.

In a real application, you would:
1. Either download Bootstrap files and place them here manually
2. Or use LibMan (Library Manager) to manage client-side libraries
3. Or use npm/yarn with a build process to manage these dependencies

For example, to add Bootstrap using LibMan in Visual Studio:
1. Right-click on the 'wwwroot' or 'lib' folder
2. Select "Add" > "Client-Side Library"
3. Search for "bootstrap"
4. Choose the version and files you want to include
5. Click "Install"

Alternatively, you can use a package manager like npm and include:
- bootstrap
- jquery
- popper.js (if needed by Bootstrap)
